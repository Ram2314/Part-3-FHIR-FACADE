### Facade Design Pattern

#### Overview

The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. By using a facade, you can reduce the complexity of interactions between the client and the subsystem, making the client code easier to use and maintain. The facade provides a high-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use by hiding its complexities.

#### Key Concepts

- **Facade**: The main class that provides a simplified interface to the complex subsystem.
- **Subsystem**: The complex system that the facade simplifies. The subsystem may include various classes and methods that perform the actual work.
- **Client**: The code that interacts with the facade to use the subsystem's functionality without needing to understand its complexities.

#### Benefits

- **Simplified Interface**: Provides a single, simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the client from the subsystem, reducing dependencies.
- **Ease of Use**: Makes the subsystem easier to use by providing a high-level interface.
- **Improved Maintenance**: Makes the system easier to maintain and extend by encapsulating complex interactions.

### FHIR Facade

#### Overview

FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically. It is designed to enable easy interoperability between healthcare systems by defining a set of resources and an API for accessing them. A FHIR facade applies the Facade Design Pattern to simplify interactions with a FHIR server.

#### Key Concepts

- **FHIR Server**: The complex subsystem that provides healthcare data according to the FHIR standard.
- **FHIR Facade**: A simplified interface that provides easy access to the functionality of the FHIR server without exposing its complexities.
- **Client**: The code that interacts with the FHIR facade to access healthcare data.

#### Benefits

- **Simplified Interaction**: Provides a simple interface to access complex healthcare data.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the client from the FHIR server, reducing dependencies.
- **Ease of Use**: Makes it easier for developers to interact with the FHIR server by providing high-level methods.
- **Improved Maintenance**: Encapsulates complex interactions, making the system easier to maintain and extend.

By using the Facade Design Pattern in conjunction with FHIR, you can create a clean and maintainable interface for interacting with complex healthcare data systems.
